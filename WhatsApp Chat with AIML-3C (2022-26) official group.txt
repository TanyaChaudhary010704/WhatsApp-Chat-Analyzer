12/12/22, 7:12 pm - Vikas Sir: *Important notice :* 
1. All of you students have to take special care of discipline in the class. 
2. All students should be inside the class before 8:50 am. 
3. Make sure all the students are in their class before 1:10 pm after lunch. 
4. If you take any pre-determined leave or take any emergency leave, then your parents should be informed about it.
12/12/22, 7:56 pm - Ritin Sir: *||The Importance of Attending Class||*
*Dream and dedication are a powerful combination of time.*

Dear all,
As your academic session is started and I have encountered many students who need to attend classes on a regular basis. It is absolutely vital that you attend class regularly. Missing a class should be a rare occurrence, something that happens at most once or twice a semester. If you miss class more than this, it will interfere with your learning and have a negative effect on your performance and your overall performance.

A prerequisite to success in any endeavour is "showing up", and classes are no exception.

So I request everyone to attend classes on a daily basis without any failure. 

For any issue, kindly contact your Mentor/CC/PL

Thanks
12/12/22, 7:57 pm - Ritin Sir: *|| Reminder 2||*
Still, many students have not filled the form. Kindly fill out the from it will hardly take a few minutes.
13/12/22, 3:41 pm - Deepali Mam (Abes): Dear Students, 

It has been observed that some of the students are not taking their regular academic activities on a serious note. 

Following points should be considered on top priority from tomorrow onwards:

1. 100% attendance is mandatory in all the classes. 

2. No student is allowed to enter the class once teacher enters the class. 

3. Please reach before 8:45 AM in the First Class. 

4. If on pre planned leave do take prior approval from CC and PLs after the telephonic conversation with the parents. 

5. In case of emergency leave, do connect with CC and PL. 

6. If student fails to attend classes without any prior information, then his/her parents will be called in the college for discussion. 

7. Indiscipline and nuisance in the classes will not be tolerated at all.

19/03/23, 12:54 pm - Deepali Mam (Abes): Dear Students,

All the best for the university examination !!!!

It is requested from each and every student to go through the syllabus covered in each and every subject throughly.

Please ensure:

1. Go through the last year question papers very carefully

2. Do write the detailed solution of each question rather than writing in shortcuts.

3. Express yourself in detail in each and every question. Expressing to the fullest plays a key role in achieving good marks.      

4. Pictorial representation should be strong enough to score good marks in the exams.

5. Do solve numerical question in detail.

6. Do highlight the important part with other pen.

7. Kindly use black and blue pen both.

8. Donot leave any question unattempted. 

9. If question paper is tough then donot panic in that situation. Try to attempt those questions first which you can write in detail.

10. All students have to earn atleast 30 marks in university examination to avoid  carry over.

11. Please report on time to examination center to avoid last minute rush.

Hope all will perform better and achieve excellent marks in first semester university examination.

Thanks and Regards

Dear Students,

All the best for the university examination !!!!

It is requested from each and every student to go through the syllabus covered in each and every subject thoroughly.

*Please ensure and read the following instructions carefully*:

1. Go through *last year's question papers* very carefully.
2. Do write the detailed *solution of each question* rather than writing in shortcuts.
3. Express your *answers in detail for each and every question.* Expressing to the fullest plays a key role in achieving good marks.      
4. *Pictorial representation should be strong enough to score good marks in the exams.*
5. Do solve *numerical questions in detail and highlight* the important part with different pen.
6. Any cheating related case or not following the center guidelines regarding seating in the examination room will lead to the UFM case , and a single UFM case will give you backs in multiple subjects. 
7.Do not try to get involved in any such activity which leads to the UFM case. 
8. Do not *leave any questions unattempted and  use good black and blue pens.*
9. If the question *paper is tough then do not panic in that situation.* Try to attempt those questions first which you can write in detail.
10. *All students have to earn at least minimum 40 marks in university examinations* to avoid  carry over.
11. Please report on time to the examination center to avoid the last minute rush.

I hope you all will perform better and achieve excellent marks in the second semester university examinations.

For any queries and problems you face immediately contact me, subject teacher ,class coordinator.

Best wishes

3. Write section with part in starting of every Question

Like PART-B [Q. 3(a) ]
and you can use highlighter to make extra attention as question break. 
4. Use two line separators as a question break. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Don't leave a blank page or half attempted question in starting, it seems to be a bad impression before copy Checker.

All the best for the examination !!!!

It is requested from each and every student to go through the syllabus covered in each and every subject throughly.

Please ensure:

1. Go through the question papers very carefully

2. Do write the detailed solution of each question rather than writing in shortcuts.

3. Express yourself in detail in each and every question. Expressing to the fullest plays a key role in achieving good marks.      
4. Pictorial representation should be strong enough to score good marks in the exams.

5. Do solve numerical question in detail.

6. Do highlight the important part with other pen.

7. Kindly use black and blue pen both.

8. Don't get absent in any STs because absentism will effect internal marks.

9. Don't bring any cheating material as it leads to UFM.

Hope all will perform better and achieve excellent marks in Sessional test 1

Thanks and Regards

Dear Students

It is expected from all the students to maintain the following:

1. 100% attendance in all the classes from Tuesday  onwards. 

2. Next 18 days is very crucial from the Academic perspectives.(No leaves will be entertained during this tenure). 

3. It has been observed that attendance in first lecture is on the lower side. From Tuesday onwards, if any student fail to reach the class before 8:50 then he/she will not be allowed in the class during the whole day. 

Kindly take academic classes very seriously. 

*Note:* If any student have any genuine issue then he/she must take prior approval of leave from PL getting application signed as well as conversation with parents.

Failing to maintain the process will lead to serious consequences. <This message was edited>

07/02/24, 1:43 pm - +91 84477 68492: Dear All
kindly refer following messsge regarding  proposals submission for funding under UBA SEGs 
 
Greetings from Unnat Bharat Abhiyan, A flagship Program of MoE (GoI), Nationally Coordinated by IIT Delhi.

We would like to inform you that we have opened the Subjet Expert Group (SEG) portal for the second round of proposals submission for funding under UBA SEGs from 26th January to 9th February 2024.

Please note that currently the portal is open for submission of proposals by participating institutes under 5 SEGs who have completed the process of evaluation in the first round and the details are given below:

1. Capacity Building, Strategy for Convergence and Implementation of Various Govt. Schemes - Dr. R. Ramesh, NIRD&PR Hyderabad

2. ⁠Ethos in Technical Institutions - Prof. Anand B. Rao, IIT Bombay

3. Rural Energy Systems - Prof. P.M.V. Subbarao, IIT Delhi

4. Sanitation & Solid Waste Management- Prof. Indumathi Nambi, IIT Madras

5. Sustainable Agriculture System - Dr. R.N. Padaria, IARI New Delhi

PIs can access the Unnat Bharat Abhiyan website using the following direct login link: https://unnatbharatabhiyan.gov.in/pi/login then can navigate to the "Apply for SEG Proposal" tab located on the left side of their dashboard/screen and can select the SEG of their interest to submit the proposal under 2 categories; namely Technology Development and Technology Customization.

Technology Development: This category involves the submission of proposals where the technological interventions are already developed in the lab and they are now ready to disseminate in the field/ rural areas. The technological interventions should be the solution to the problem identified in the initial baseline survey in that particular area and the fund cap under this category is ₹1,00,000. PIs should ensure that the solutions submitted by them are fully sustainable, innovative, implementable and scalable, also, PIs should ensure the sustainability of the project after the completion of the project. There is no scope for mere lab projects or proto-types and all solutions and should have been tested at the field level and it should be demand driven.
Technology Customization: This category involves the technological interventions which are already available in the market but require some alterations/modifications to benefit the rural population according to their geographical locations. The proposal should specify a time target for specific outputs. The fund cap for this category is ₹50,000 and PIs should ensure the sustainability of the project after the completion of the project.  
Note: Long-term research projects/fellowships of any kind, cost on Ph.D. programs, setting up laboratories/centres, exhibitions and similar events, workshops and capital/construction are not available through the Unnat Bharat Abhiyan program, as the mandate of UBA SEG is to provide the financial support for technical interventions in the fields ( In UBA connected village) not for R&D.

प्यारे विद्यार्थियों

१.) सभी question को attempt करे ।
२.) कोशिश करे answer को architecture से समझायें ।
३.) question को उसके अंक के हिसाब से लिखे । ऐसा करने से सभी questions को attempt करने का वक्त मिल सकेगा ।
४.) Answer sheet में cutting ना हों। cutting से बंचे।
५.) Headings को Black Ball pen से और content/ architecture को Blue pen से लिखे। पेंसिल का use ना करे।
६.) unit 4 & unit 5 के सभी Topics का at- least एक बार Review जरूर कर लें ।

मेरी शुभकामनाएं आपके साथ

2) Always mention the formula first clearly then proceed for calculations
3) In testing questions your first step should be to mention null and alternative hypothesis then proceed for calculations.
4) In control chart graph clearly label each line and points.
5)Write steps clearly and in proper manner. Try to avoid overwritting and cutting in calculations.

All the best😃😃

The students are requested to arrange their commute accordingly and not to park any 4 wheeler vehicle on the main/ service road in front of gate no.1.

Appropriate action shall be initiated against students, in case of any violation of the above guidelines.

Pledge:
Youth is the energy of any nation and the power of youth has an important contribution in the development of society and country. Therefore, it is very important that maximum number of youth join the drug free India campaign. Accepting this challenge of the country, today we unite under the Nasha Mukt Bharat Abhiyan and take a pledge that not only the community, family, friends, but also ourselves will be drug free because change should start with ourselves.
So let us all together take a firm decision to make our district/state…..(name) drug-free.
I pledge that I will do everything possible to the best of my ability to make my country drug-free.

Jai Hind!
युवा किसी भी राष्ट्र की ऊर्जा होते हैं तथा युवाओं की शक्ति का समाज एवं देश के विकास में महत्वपूर्ण योगदान है। अतः यह अति आवश्यक है कि नशामुक्त भारत अभियान में सर्वाधिक संख्या में युवा जुड़े। देश की इस चुनौती को स्वीकार करते हुए हम आज नशामुक्त भारत अभियान के अंतर्गत एक जुट होकर प्रतिज्ञा करते हैं कि न केवल समुदाय, परिवार, मित्र, बल्कि स्वयं को भी नशामुक्त कराएँगे क्योंकि बदलाव की शुरुआत अपने आप से होनी चाहिए।
इसलिए आइए हम सब मिलकर अपने ज़िले/ राज्य…..(नाम) को नशामुक्त कराने का दृढ निश्चय करें।
मैं प्रतिज्ञा करता हूँ कि अपने देश को नशामुक्त करने के लिए अपनी क्षमता के अनुसार हर सम्भव प्रयास करूँगा।

जय हिन्द!

My heartfelt warm wishes for your exam. I truly believe you all are blessed with immense potential and a compassionate heart , so take care of the few points before you head for the day: 
1. Use two inks blue and black.
2. Write very precise /accurate answers along with the most relevant catalyst like  flow diagrams and precise examples etc.
3. And do not lose your calm while interacting with anyone like auto rickshaw driver, the invigilating team, the people engaged to help in conducting your exam smoothly at your centre.
*Keep your heads high and come back safely*

Showers of prayers and good vibes to each one of you!
